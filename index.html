            <p>I am Udoeyen Aniefiok Okon, a registered Quantity Surveyor and certified
                Project Manager, from the oil rich Niger Delter region of Nigeria. I am now studying Web and Computer
                programming aiming at a bachelor degree in Professional Studies. I want to add technology to my project
                management practices on graduation. I am so happy to have this opportunity.</p>
        
            <p>I have over 15 years of experience in project management and contract administration. I am seeking to
                establish my business in
                the commercial city of Lagos, Nigeria.
                Recently, I assisted a contractor in recovering over ₦8 billion in contractual claims and successfully
                managed a
                250-unit housing estate project, completing it on time and within budget for another client.
                I am detail-oriented, ethical, and transparent in my work. My services can help you procure your projects
                with 100%
                performance.</p>
        
            <p>Additionally, in my role as Contract Administrator for the construction of the 21-story Office Complex and
                the
                International Worship Center in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria, I had the opportunity to work with two
                international
                construction companies, Julius Berger PLC and VKC Construction Ltd. My responsibilities included presiding
                over project
                meetings, facilitating communication between contractors and project sponsors, monitoring progress and
                costs, managing
                change orders, and processing payments. These experiences have thoroughly prepared me for the position of
                Project
                Coordinator. </p>
