    <h1>The City of Dubai, UAE</h1>

    <p>Dubai is so organized with very high quality infrastructure. As a professional, I would love to live and work in there.</p>
    <p>When I first visited Dubai, I was trilled by how patient the people were. Cars will wait for me to cross the road when I stand by the road side. If a car is stopping by to drop a passenger, other cars will patiently wait for him. No horning, no horrying.</p>
